# React + Vite Project

This project is built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for fast development and bundling, and uses [React](https://react.dev/) for the UI.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
cd cs490-group-5-frontend/
```
### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
This installs everything listed in package.json, including React, Vite, and any UI libraries like lucide-react.

### 3. Install additional library
```bash
npm install lucide-react
```

### 4. Install Router
```bash
npm install react-router-dom
```

To check and confirm succesfully downloaded: 
```bash
npm list react-router-dom
```

### 5. Start developmental server
```bash
npm run dev
```

Notes-
You donâ€™t need to install Vite globally (npm install -g vite) â€” it runs from the local project setup.
